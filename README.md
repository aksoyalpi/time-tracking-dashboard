## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- JavaScript
- Data fetching
- DOM Manipulation
- CSS data attributes

### What I learned

- Working more performant with css data classes in combination with JavaScript DOM manipulation

### Continued development

Of course, it would be better to work with frameworks like React, but I wanted to use only native architectures to better understand what happens in the background.
In the future, nevertheless I will work with Frameworks.
